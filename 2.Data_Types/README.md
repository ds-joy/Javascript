There are six primitive data types in javascript
1.Number  (Floting point numbers for decimals  and integers)
2.Strings (Sequence of characters)
3.Boolean (Logical data type. true/false)
4.Undefined (Data type of a veriable that does not have a value yet)
5.Null (Means non-existing)

here we would like to assign these five types of values to veriables and see the output in the console
